    This had been developed by the request of Voxel 3D. The project description had been defined as follows:

    1. From QGIS, there should be a button for connecting to the server.
    2. The plugin will show a window with a text field for introducing the "token" of the user.
    3. After login, the oblique window has to be displayed with this message: "Obliquo started".
    4. In QGIS, there should be another button which calls the server for an oblique image when you click on the map.
    if the server doesn't return any oblique, the oblique window should show the message: "Image not available in this position".
    If the server returns an oblique, it should be displayed.
    5. The API includes buttons for controlling the oblique (rotation, measurement, etc).
    6. In QGIS there should be a button for closing the connection. When you press it, the oblique window gets closed and it disconnects from the serve.
