<h2>Job description </h2>

<p>
    I need someone to build a QGIS Plugin (python, interface I think is qt).<br>
    Basically it will allow the user to plot complex polygons by specifying the parts as this: line from point X to point Y,<br>
    then an arc, centered at point Z, having a radius of 10nm and running 90 degrees, then another line etc.<br>
    <br>
    I need an easy interface for this. I have code from other plugins I modified that might be useful,<br>
    but I prefer if you come with a good code from yourself, as my code has some bugs.<br>
    <br>
    I want to decide who I am going to contract as soon as possible, probably until Wednesday, this is a serious proposition.<br>
    <br>
    Don't bid if you don't have Qgis Plugins knowledge.<br>
    <br>
    Thanks very much for your time.<br>
</p>
