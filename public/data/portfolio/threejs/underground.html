    This web application renders drill hole data using Three.js.
    One drill hole has longitude, latitude, elevation, dip, azimuth, depth attributes.
    Longitude, latitude and elevation defines the geographic position of the drill hole on the earth surface.
    Dip is the angle formed by tangent plane and drill hole direction. So the value of minus 90 degree means a vertical drill hole straight down.

    Azimuth defines the horizontal direction of a drill hole so the value of zero indicates the true north direction.

    In this project to convert the geographic data of drill hole data to local coordinates defined in Three.js I had used CesiumJS.
