<h2>Job description</h2>

<p>
    We can give you the vue-cli or you create it by your own.
    There must be three.js installed through npm and then we would give you 4 3d files (fbx, obj, stl, gltf)
    and one of them must be loaded and displayed into the canvas which is inside of the vue project. And the 3d files must be loaded from local harddrive(project folder or whatever, but not from internet)
</p>

<p>
    Please include/expand our last project with this library

    We will deliver 4 urdf files for the test. Drag and drop is nice to have, but not necessary
