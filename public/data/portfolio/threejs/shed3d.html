<h2>Overview </h2>

<p>
    3D Building Designer, the product of the
    <a href="https://www.3dfish.net/">https://www.3dfish.net/</a>
    3D fish lets customers visualize the different types of building they would like to purchase,
    giving them opportunity to select the style, the size, the siding, the colors and,
    the placing of the doors, windows, and other accessories exactly where they want them to be, both inside and outside of the building.
    For now it supports Shed, Horse Barn, Carport types.<br>
    In this project, I worked on the following several issues.
</p>

<h3>
    Create Element Viewer / Editor utility
</h3>
<p>“This Should show the x, y, z coordinates and select and turn the view of each object that is part of the element on or off, also should allow for editing of each object's parameters.”
</p>

<h3>Use BufferGeometry everywhere
</h3>
<p>
    “Geometry should be considered legacy and BufferGeometry should be used exclusively.”
</p>


<h3>Show attachable elements on the right click menu</h3>
<p>
    “The right-click element menu needs to show any available attached elements and let them be selected and added to the element.”
</p>

<h3>Create an edit selector for selected element</h3>
<p>
    “Create an edit icon – a circle with a pencil – that a user can click to access the right-click menu”
</p>

<h3>Separate shutters and trim from windows
</h3>
<p>
    “Windows need to have a left and right connect point that would be centered vertically on the window.
    Also, should have a top and bottom connect point for additional options such as flower boxes.
    Trim elements would be able to be added to a window and provide an additional set of connect points to add shutters in addition to trim.
    They should be a connected element similar to hinges on doors
    Shutters should have a right and left connect point for universal shutters and a left or right connect point for left and right shutters.”
</p>

<h3>Use the same lighting setup for mobile and desktop</h3>
<p>
    “The light rig is more complex than it needs to be. With a bit of tweaking, you should be able to get better results with only lights, which will give a good performance improvement and simplify your code.
    Instead of creating an extra light for shadows on desktop only, use the same lights and switch off/switch to lower quality shadows on mobile if you need to. Given the complexity of your scene, I suspect that with some optimization you will find that shadows will work fine on mobile.”
</p>

<h3>Use a real environment map
</h3>
<p>
    “This will go a long way to improving the realism and lighting quality in your scenes with a minimal performance impact.
    You can see that yours is much lower quality. Also, it appears low resolution and stretched, even though it is the same or higher resolution than the three.js examples.”
</p>

<h3></h3>
<p>

</p>

<h3>Improve glass material
</h3>
<p>
    “We need to create accurate reflection in the windows.”
</p>

<h3></h3>
<p>

</p>

<h3>Camera class is doing too much
</h3>
<p>
    “The only tasks I would expect a Camera class to perform are things related to camera creation and state.”
