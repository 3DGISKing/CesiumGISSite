    QGlobe is an immature, open source virtual globe software based on Qt 4.5.2 and Irrlicht Engine(http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/). It all started way back in 2010.
    One day I saw Google Earth and I was surprised about it. But using Google Earth in our country (China) was somewhat limited. So, I was determined to develop my own Virtual Globe which works well in China. Come to think about it now, that sounds like a monkey thought. But it was a valuable first time as a 3D GIS software developer.


    QGlobe uses the OpenGL version of the Irrlicht Engine as the rendering engine.
    It ‘s UI is made of Qt.
    QGlobe renders the entire globe with tiled image, terrain, vector and 3D mesh.
    QGlobe has the ability to open, edit and render KML.
    It has simple measurement functions.
    It has the tour, flying function similar to Google Earth.
    It can be run as standalone or C/S.
    The standalone version reads directly all necessary data for rendering from the configured path from the local computer and in the client version all data for rendering is streamed from the server .
    In QGlobe all image, terrain, vector and 3d data are from the preprocessed tiled, so called “block” files. Each “block” file contains 128 * 128 tile and it is designed to quickly find the tile by tile identifier.
