<h2>Job description </h2>

<p>
    This project is helping us troubleshoot how a Progressive Web App connects to our Wordpress multisite install.<br>
    We previously had the PWA connecting to  <a href="https://myuvn.com">https://myuvn.com</a>
    but are moving our websites to a different url at  <a href="https://campusvisitorguides.com">https://campusvisitorguides.com</a>
    but we are having trouble getting the PWA to connect to this new website.<br>
    I believe it could be a cors issue or a conflict with a caching plugin.
</p>

<p>
   <b>PWA Details:</b>
    The PWA is built on React, Bootstrap and JQuery.<br>
    It utilizes Google Maps API, Google Places API, and the Wordpress REST API.<br>
    The content is pulled from the wordpress database.<br>
    All of the websites are hosted on a Wordpress Multisite Network (

    <a href="https://campusvisitorguides.com/rutgers/">https://campusvisitorguides.com/rutgers/</a>).<br>
    The page content as well as the business listings and tour points get pulled from the WP DB.<br>
    Please ask any questions you might have to better understand this scope of this project.<br>
    If we are happy with the communication and work,  we will want to discuss a flat.<br>
</p>
