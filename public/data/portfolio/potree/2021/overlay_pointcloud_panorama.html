<p>
    The goal of this project is to overlay point cloud data on the top of the panorama image.<br/>
    The camera of potree is fixed to the position of the panorama shot(the x,y,z values contained in the metadata of the panorama)
    and the user will only be available to rotate the view,but not move the camera.) <br/>
    When the user moves the view in the point cloud, the camera is synchronized with the panoramic image accordingly.<br/>
    So users can work this way until we are able to synchronize the visualization of both datasets.
