<h2>
    Job description
</h2>

<p>
    It measures the vertical distance to the ground by clicking on one point (without the need to click on the ground). <br>
    The objective of this request is to use it for any elevated cables (i.e. powerlines, telephone, etc) or infrastructures (bridges).<br>
    We want to have a quick way of measuring the height of one point above the ground.<br>
    In case of cables, it is very likely to have ground below  the cable, but we can make things easier for this request<br>
    and calculate the height above the first object you find in the vertical projection of the point.<br>
    When you click on a point, the tool draws the vertical line from the point to the ground and returns the height.

    <h3>
    Use case
    </h3>

    <ol>
    <li>
        user click the new tool button in Measurement Tool box.
    </li>

    <li>
        user clicks any point.
    </li>
        At this time a sphere will be displayed(not one point). <br><br>
        get clicked position.<br>
        construct a RayCaster.<br>

        RayCaster â€˜s origin will be the position of the clicked position.<br><br>
        get point cloud which intersects with RayCaster<br>
        get the closest point in the selected point cloud.<br>

        <li>
            If the closest ground point is found, a line from the clicked position to the closest ground point will be shown and also an annotation which shows the vertical distance.
            <br>
            If not, nothing happens.
        </li>

        <li>
            Mouse move will be not handled because it is expected this would be bit cpu intensive.
        </li>

    </ol>
