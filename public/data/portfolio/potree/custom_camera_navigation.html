    Job description
</h2>

<p>
    Goal of this project is to write a custom navigation class for Potree 1.7.2. <br>

    Depending on the distance of the camera to a surface of the point cloud,<br>
    it should switch automatically between 3rd and 1st Person mode.<br>
    So, if the user gets close to an object it switches into 1st person mode, if he scrolls further away it switches into 3rd person mode.<br>
    An explanation of the functionality of each mode follows.<br>
    For better understanding we compare the required functionality with examples of the Potree Demo and the Google Maps navigation.<br>

PC & MAC
Mouse Left
    -3rd Person
    Click and drag the map or point cloud over the screen along the ground plane (like Potree Earth Control Mouse Left or Google Maps Mouse Left).
    The problem with the standard earth control of Potree is, that it doesnâ€™t work on the map, but only on the point cloud.
    -1st Person
    Drag the camera along the camera plane (like Potree Orbit Control Mouse Right)
Mouse Right OR Ctrl + Mouse Left
    -3rd Person
    Rotate the Camera around the point in the viewport center (like Potree Orbit Control Mouse Left or Google Maps Ctrl + Mouse Left)
Mouse Right OR Ctrl + Mouse Left
    -1st Person
    Rotate the Camera fixed to the camera position (like Potree Fly Control)
Scroll Wheel
    -3rd Person
    Move the camera forwards / backwards to the mouse cursor position. Adjust speed with distance (like Potree Earth Control Scroll or Google Maps Scroll)
    -1st Person
    Same as 3.3.1

    Move the camera forwards / backwards / sideways. (like Potree Fly Control)
