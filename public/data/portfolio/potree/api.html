    This project had been done by the request of Voxel 3D and the project requirement had been as follows.
    “We will need a node.js module/function which will receive the XY coordinates in 3857 and get the height of the closer point in a single point cloud in the format of the example”.
    In this project I had developed the Node.js module which parses a potree file format and integrated it with Proj4js.
