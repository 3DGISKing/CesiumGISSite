<p>
    We want to have a viewer switch allowing us to have a single window with a map in OpenLayers  and have 3 buttons: one for
    hanging to globe view (Cesium JS), another one for changing to Potree view and another one for returning to the 2D map.
    We want all the three views to be synchronized in terms of zoom. I mean: assuming we always start with a 2D map,
    when we click on the "3D" (globe) button, we want to see it centered in the same point, with the same bearing and the same zoom level.<br/>
    The same when we go to the point cloud (potree) view from the 2D map.
    We would like to include  the reverse switch from 3D environments to 2D in the project.<br/>
    The desired behavior would be using the center point of the 3D view as the reference point in which the 2D map should
    be centered and use the height of the camera (from the terrain) to calculate the zoom level in the 2D map.<br>

    We also want to include in the project the switch between Cesium and Potree views maintaining the same camera position.<br/>
    So <br/>
    App will start with a 2D OpenLayers map.
    App will have 3 buttons: one for switching from 2D to Cesium js 3D view one for switching from 2D to Potree 3D view one for returning from 3D(Cesium or Potree) to the 2D view.
