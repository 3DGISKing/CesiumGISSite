    Job description
</h2>

<p>
    It is necessary to modify the functionality of the CesiumJS library so that it is possible to project the texture video stream at an angle.<br>
    We just monitored any modifications and solutions based on the CesiumJS library and found a cool feature with camera projection
    in the SuperMap project. And then my colleagues found your YouTube channel with different demos with images projections
    in Cesium and showed it to me.<br>
    So I decided to try to connect with you to find out if it is possible to make a feature like this for our project.<br>
    Our main goal is to implement outdoor cameras of our city with a projection of their signals onto a photogrammetry 3D model
    to make this part of the model alive with actual real-time video.<br>
    There are thousands of cameras in the city with streaming video, and each of them we want to project.<br>
    My colleagues gave me an example of API that they think is the best example of the implementation of this feature:<br><br>

    <a href="https://iserver.supermap.io/iserver/iClient/for3D/webgl/en/docs/Documentation/ProjectionImage.html?classFilter=pro">
        SuperMap ProjectionImage API</a>

    <br>

    And I also attached an example of a video with tests of how we want to use this projection.
