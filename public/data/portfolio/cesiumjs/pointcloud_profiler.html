<h2>
    Overview
</h2>

<p>
    In this project I had made the so-called the PointCloudProfiler CesiumJS mixin by which the user can inspect the vertical profile of point cloud 3d tileset in the CesiumJS application.

<h3>
    Functions
</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        When the PointCloudProfiler is enabled, the user can draw a polyline in the 3D scene.
    </li>

    <li>
        When the drawing is finished(by double click or Esc), the profile window appears.
    </li>

    <li>
        The profile window shows the point cloud profile for the drawn polyline.
    </li>

    <li>
        Also it shows the meta information about the selected point which is changed by mouse move.
    </li>

    <li>
        The coordinate of the selected point can be displayed by custom EPSG.
    </li>

    <li>
        The width of the polyline can be changed by the user and the profile is immediately updated.
    </li>

    <li>
        The drawn polyline can be moved and rotated and the profile is immediately updated.
    </li>

    <li>
        The profile data can be exported via CSV or LAS.
    </li>
</ul>
