<h2>
    Job description
</h2>

<p>
    I want someone to implement a navigation that is similar to Google Street View, in particular:

   <pre>
1. when a user clicks a point, the camera should move to that point
    a. orientation of camera should be the same when moving
    b. height of camera to the ground of the 3D tile should be the same when moving
    Please refer to the attached image.
2. Cesium.ScreenSpaceEventType.LEFT_DOWN should be the same as Google Street View
   so that the screen does not keep tilting to the side when the user is looking around.
   This can be seen in Cesium when the user holds SHIFT+LEFT_DOWN to rotate around,
   the camera is being rotated around the point at which it is located.
   This should include a button which when pressed will make the camera upright
   so that there is no tilt in relation to the 3D tileset.
   </pre>
