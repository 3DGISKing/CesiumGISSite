Overview
This project demonstrates the simple CesiumJS camera controlling similar to Google Street View.

Functions.
1 When a user clicks a point, the camera should move to that point
a. The orientation of the camera should be the same when moving.
b. the height of the camera to the ground of the 3D tile should be the same when moving.

2. Cesium.ScreenSpaceEventType.LEFT_DOWN should be same as Google Street View
so that the screen does not keep tilting to the side when the user is looking around.
This can be seen in Cesium when the user holds SHIFT+LEFT_DOWN to rotate around.
