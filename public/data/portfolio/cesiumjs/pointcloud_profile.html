This project had been done by the request of Voxel 3D in which I had made the so-called the PointCloudProfiler CesiumJS mixin by which the user can inspect the vertical profile of point cloud 3d tileset in the CesiumJS application.

Functions
- When the PointCloudProfiler is enabled, the user can draw a polyline in the 3D scene.
- When the drawing is finished(by double click or Esc), the profile window appears.
- The profile window shows the point cloud profile for the drawn polyline.
- Also it shows the meta information about the selected point which is changed by mouse move.
- The coordinate of the selected point can be displayed by custom EPSG.
- The width of the polyline can be changed by the user and the profile is immediately updated.
- The drawn polyline can be moved and rotated and the profile is immediately updated.
- The profile data can be exported via CSV or LAS.
