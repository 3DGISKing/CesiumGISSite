     is the platform to share massive photogrammetry models and large point clouds with ease.

    I had worked for two years with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrianonsen/">Mr. Adrian Onsen </a>  to develop Construkted Reality.
</p>

<p>
    I was responsible for the backend to prepare the asset from the uploaded raw data and also the frontend related to CesiumJS.

    The backend was developed with Node.js and it receives the request of users and then converts the uploaded raw photogrammetry 3d model or Lidar data to CesiumJS ‘s 3D Tile.
    After preparing the asset, the backend uploads all tiled data to the S3 bucket.

    In order to freely wander around the asset, I had implemented the FPV(First Person View) function.
    Also I had developed asset measurement and positioning functions.
