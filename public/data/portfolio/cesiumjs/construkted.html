    is the platform to share massive photogrammetry models and large point clouds with ease.

<p>
    Users can view, share, and store their billion polygon 3D models or multi-billion point clouds
    by assets created with a very simple upload operation.

    I had worked for two years with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrianonsen/">Mr. Adrian Onsen </a> to develop Construkted Reality since 2018.
</p>

<p>
    I was responsible not only for the backend to prepare the asset from the uploaded raw data but also for the frontend related to CesiumJs.
</p>

<p>
    The backend provides REST API made from Node.js and it basically receives the request of users and then converts the uploaded raw photogrammetry 3d model or Lidar data to CesiumJs â€˜s 3D tile format.
</p>

<p>
    It efficiently manages a number of tiling tasks considering the power of the server.
    Besides a basic endpoint for processing the tiling request the backend also exposes several endpoints for managing concurrently executing tiling tasks and 3d assets.
</p>

<p>
    For the 3d data management Construkted Reality uses a WordPress theme called gowatch which is originally designed for sharing videos and
    I had successfully customized this theme for our purpose.
    I have also made several WordPress endpoints to communicate with backend API.

<p>
    For the frontend part I implemented FPV(First Person View), asset geo-positioning, automatic FPS control, measuring, and immersive XR, and AJAX. <br/>

    It's been really my pleasure to work with a cool and technical man such as Adrian.
