<h2> Job description</h2>
I need to create a Web GIS application, on my website selling 3d maps.
    The site was developed with WordPress/woocommerce.<br/>
I need to visualize an interactive 3D satellite map defined by the website's visitor with a square,
similar to what you have in your demo or it would be even better if it looked like the picture I have attached.

<h2>Project description</h2>

First, users go to the 2D map page made by Google Map API.<br/>
There he specifies two positions, starting point, and destination point.<br/>
Then he finds the route between the start point and destination point using Google Map API.<br/>

Next, users click the “Create 3D Map” button so finally the 3d map of the
area containing the found route will be created. The route will be shown and highlighted on the terrain surface of the created 3d map.<br>
