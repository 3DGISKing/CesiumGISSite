    Sometimes we need to host 3d tilesets on our server. It can be implemented by a simple node js express server.
    But you can notice that the 3d tileset contains nested folders with thousands of small files. It is critical if you plan to download and upload a bunch of 3d tilesets.
    One solution would be to use the sqlite format which Cesium introduces.
    This is a simple 3d tile server based on the sqlite format of the 3d tileset. Server is based on CodeIgniter-3.1.10.
