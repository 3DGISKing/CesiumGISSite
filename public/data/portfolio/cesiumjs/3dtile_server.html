<h2>Job description</h2>

<p>
    I need a client and server code written in PHP which will serve files stored in a SQLITE db.
    <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/appfileformat.html"> https://www.sqlite.org/appfileformat.html</a>

    <br/>
    There are already many servers of this type written on github. Some examples:

    <a href="https://github.com/search?q=mb+server"> </a>
</p>
The server code will reside on a EC2 instance.
<p>
    The client code needs to integrate with a WordPress site and use CesiumJS to display data from the SQLITE database.

</p>
<p>
    Sample SQLITE file will be provided upon job start.

</p>

<p>
    I am looking for someone with full-stack experience to develop the client and server code as well integrate the code into WordPress.

<h3>
    Detailed description
</h3>

<p>
    Sometimes we need to host 3d tilesets on our server instead of Cesium Ion when the data are sensitive to the restricted public access requirement.
    It can be implemented by a simple node js express server. But you can notice that the 3d tileset contains nested folders with thousands of small files.
    It is critical if you plan to download and upload a bunch of 3d tilesets.
</p>

<p>
    One solution would be to use the SQLite format which Cesium team introduces.
</p>

<p>
    This is a simple 3d tile server based on the SQLite format of the 3d tileset. This custom 3d tile server was made with CodeIgniter-3.1.10.
</p>

<p>
    First, you have to convert the 3d tileset to SQLite format to use this server. You can refer to this
    <a href="https://medium.com/@cesiumgis/how-to-make-sqlite-database-from-cesium-3d-tile-file-system-9e22b94cd0f8">link</a> for it.
</p>
<p>
    Then copy it and paste it to the “asset” folder of the CodeIgniter.
</p>

<p>
    If tilesets have a more deep level, then add routing rules in application/config/routes.php. We can remove index.php in tileset.json URL by using rewrite rule.
