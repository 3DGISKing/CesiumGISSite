    - Implement basic WASD control on the 3d tile model from example: https://cesiumjs.org/Cesium/Build/Apps/Sandcastle/?src=Clamp%20to%203D%20Tiles.html&label=3D%20Tiles

    - Ability to "look" around using a mouse, just like in a FPS game.
    Click and drag to look around.
    - Basic terrain clamping, so that the camera maintains a pre-set (1.65m) altitude above the 3d tile mesh model, with minimal collision detection. (Collision detection of walls or other vertical surfaces will be added later)
