    <em>Map Share</em>
</p>

<h2>Job description </h2>
<p>
    We will create a website which allows users to describe their project on cesiumjs viewer and save their work and get a permanent link to share with other people.
</p>



<b>1  Draw Boundary.</b>

<p>
    We will ask the user its area coordinates for the boundary (with polygon).
    Sample input format is to draw your licensed area please put the point coordinates for polygon.

</p>

Example:

<p><img src="/data/portfolio/cesiumjs/simple_3d_map_share_1.png" alt="">
    <em>input example</em>
</p>

<p>
    And we take the last point from the user, connect it with the first point so the polygon is ready. Like this white one below, just to show the boundary of its property.
</p>

<b>2 Put pushpins or other placemarks to places where users want to describe.</b>

<p>
    We will ask the user to put as much as the coordinate he wants then it automatically creates an icon there and when we click the icon we see the user's text explanation.

    <br/><br/>
    Example: 22.338035, -101.570855

    <br/><br/>
    the user enters this coordinate in a box or form also they enter an explanation like “ this is an old building”.

    <br/>

    So when user go to the coordinate 22.338035°, -101.570855°, they will see an icon and when they click “they will read this is a old building” text
</p>


<b>3 Put pushpins or other placemarks to places where users want to upload photos  and pdfs.</b>

<p>
We will get the coordinates from the user and ask him to upload a picture. So when the user goes to that coordinate he will see an icon when he clicks the icon photo or pdf will pop up in the new window.

Finally, after doing this, the user will be able to see all work on the cesium viewer and be able to get a link for his work to share with other people.
