<h2>Overview </h2>

<p>
    This project was done by the request of
    <a href="NexGen Earth Labs(NGEL)">NexGen Earth Labs(NGEL)</a>
    , which visualized  29 million fire data points from satellites(Terra-MODIS/Aqua-MODIS).
    A PostGIS database was programmatically created from csv files using Python script on Google Cloud Compute Engine VM instance. <br>

    The backend sent the fire data for the AJAX request from the frontend, which was done by PHP.<br>

    The frontend was made of OpenLayers 5.2, bootstrap-4.1.3, jQuery, jQuery-ui, Highcharts.

        <li>
            Display data points on the map for selected periods & filtered with color bars.
        </li>
        <li>
            Time Series of selected data using filters with a box on the map. Users are able to select a certain region on the map by drawing a box. And then data extracted for the box with time-period and other filters be extracted in plotted as histogram.
        </li>
        <li>
            Filtering by country or region.
        </li>
        <li>
            The histogram shows statistics (min, max, mean, total, median, count etc) for the selected region and time window.
