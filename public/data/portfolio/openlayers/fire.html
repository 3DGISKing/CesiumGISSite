<p>
    This project was done by the request of NexGen Earth Labs(NGEL), which visualized  29 million fire data points from satellites(Terra-MODIS/Aqua-MODIS).
    A PostGIS database was created from csv files with Python script on Google Cloud Compute Engine VM instance.

    The backend sent the fire data for the AJAX request from the frontend, which was done by PHP.  The frontend was made of OpenLayers 5.2, bootstrap-4.1.3, jQuery, jQuery-ui, Highcharts.

    Functions:
    All the visual work on any of the fields selected by the user.
    Display data points on the map for selected periods & filtered with color bars.
    Time Series of selected data using filters with a box on the map. Users are able to select a certain region on the map by drawing a box. And then data extracted for the box with time-period and other filters be extracted in plotted as histogram.
    Filtering by country or region.
    The histogram shows statistics (min, max, mean, total, median, count etc) for the selected region and time window.

    This project was published to aqtrend.nexgenearth.net but it looks broken down.
