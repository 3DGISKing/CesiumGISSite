    This project was done by the request of NexGen Earth Labs(NGEL).
    This map visualizes the time series of monthly mean PM2.5 mass concentration over 2000+ cities/monitoring locations worldwide.
    The visualization provides quantitative changes for the past four decades using reanalysis data in absence of real measurements from ground monitoring stations.
