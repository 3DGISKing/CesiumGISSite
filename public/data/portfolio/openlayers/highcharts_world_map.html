    We're a not-for profit think tank working to battle climate change, looking for front-end developers.<br>
    We develop online reports to show how companies are not doing their part to combat climate change.<br>
    We want to use highcharts (<a href="https://www.highcharts.com/maps/demo/rich-info"> https://www.highcharts.com/maps/demo/rich-info</a>) chart to display some of our report findings.<br>
    Ideally you should use jsfiddle to develop the javascript required to produce the interactive chart as seen below.<br>
</p>

    In essence it is a clickable map used to select countries whose results are shown in two daughter charts.<br>
    The required data is attached.<br>
